# comp_phys_project
Part II Computational Physics Easter Project

Project Briefing Notes:

- 3000 word write-up limit
- Concetrate on computational physics aspects relevant to the project of choice
- Plan for efficiency and efficient scaling:
-- Output CPU time for completion of the given problem (breif section)

- Equal credit in the areas:
-- Analysis of computational physics
-- Implementation of Algorithim; Code style; readablilty 
-- Results and Error analysis, tests and discussions
-- Overall report presentation

Project A:

2D Fourier Transforms to investigate non-ideal mirrors in optics

Generalisation from 1D work done before, only in the far-field approximation though.

Have to introduce random, then correlated errors, to the apperture

Project B:

Runge-Kutta numerical integration to solve differential equations, finding the equations of motion of the Trojan and Greek asteroid clusters

Solve equations of motion using newtonian gravitation with 2 sources: Sun and Jupiter
